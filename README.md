# Image-Steganography
The steganography system conceals the information that the user chooses.
It first encrypts the users data with standard advanced encryption algorithm(AES) before embedding them in the image to serve as a means to prevent from information tampering.
This system uses an encryption key that is only known to the sender and the receiver(Symmetric Cipher).
